# LLM Course Journey

This folder contains my personal journey for the Large Language Models (LLM) course on Huggingface.

## Course Overview

This course will teach you about large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem:

- ðŸ¤— Transformers
- ðŸ¤— Datasets
- ðŸ¤— Tokenizers
- ðŸ¤— Accelerate
- Hugging Face Hub

Throughout this folder, you'll find notes, code samples, and experiments as I learn and apply concepts from the course.
